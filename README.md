some programs for deep learning model using google co-lab

This is a deep learning program that uses the TensorFlow library to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
for image classification. The program uses the Keras API, which is a high-level API for building and training 
deep learning models. The program also uses data augmentation techniques to generate more training data and 
regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
